# Integrated visual field generator
##

The integrated visual field (IVF) estimates the binocular visual field from the two monocular (left and right eye) visual fields (Asaoka et al. 2011; Crabb & Viswanathan 2005). The sensitivity values for each point in the IVF were computed by taking the maximum sensitivity from corresponding points in the left and right eye visual fields. The IVF generator is written in MATLAB.

This is an example 10-2 IVF:
Note that the MD values are not accurate, the code provide a graphical depiction how IVF is generated.
